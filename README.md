# Interstellar Pilot 2 Game Object Editor

A plugin for Interstellar Pilot, work like UE except more lightweight and less feature.
Designed for more casual user/player instead modder

No dependencies aside from the plugin loader itself

## Known Issue
- Some field is missing despite have the same type field with just different name variable
- Never tested to Interstellar Pilot 1 because there isn't one for PC
- Never tested to other unity game, In theory it could work as long you know what gameobject to find
